## Reflection `Industry Visit1.mp4`

### Reflection
this visit to UTM digital provided me with valuable insights into the practical applications
of concepts we study in our courses, such as cloud computing, networking, and database management.
Witnessing these technologies in action is an exciting thing for me.
Moreover, it was a great opportunity to observe how theoretical knowledge translates into real-world solutions.
This experience motivated me to apply innovative thinking and problem-solving skills in my own projects.
I also realized the significance of collaboration work and experienced intersting new things there.
overall the visit was very amazing and helpful.
