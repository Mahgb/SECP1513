## Reflection `Computer Assembling Lab.jpg`

### Reflection
The computer assembling lab was a highly engaging and practical learning experience.
It provided an opportunity to understand the intricate components that make up a computer
and how they work together to perform various tasks.
it provides me with a deeper understanding of the structure of basic components such as the CPU, RAM,
power supply, and storage devices inside the computer case. 
By physically assembling these parts, it was easier to comprehend their interconnections and dependencies,
which enhanced theoretical knowledge we gained in the classroom.
