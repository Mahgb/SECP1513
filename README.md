## Reflection `Industrial Talk1.jpg`

### Reflection
Petronas Talk was very interesting honestly! 
the talk was very  informative and helpful to me 
as a new student to gain a picture about the operations 
of one the biggest companies in malaysia ,
The session also inspired me to think critically about how businesses
in the energy sector can align their goals 
with sustainability and innovation. As a student interested 
in this field, I was motivated to explore further how I can contribute 
to such efforts, whether through research, technology, or policy advocacy.
